# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description:
This project is about MBTA bus data to determine stops between Harvard and MIT. Then an animated marker on the map will be highlight the bus routes.

I used mapbox, is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page. The mapboxgl JavaScript library is part of the Mapbox ecosystem. It allows you to add all sorts of customizations to the map. For example, you can add a marker at a specific location on the map.

## How to run:
You only need to clone my repositorie, no need install any dependency extra, just open it in your browser an click into the <show bus stops> button the marker will start to move throw the map.
  
## Road Map to the future:
In the future I want to create a system that found and follow the bus trajectory of severals vehicle.
